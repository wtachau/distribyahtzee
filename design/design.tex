\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Tournament Manager}
\begin{itemize}	\item This process is responsible for creating the tournament brackets upon request from the environment and keeping track of win/loss records for each member in the tournament
	\item Accepts ``join" messages from \texttt{Players} to add them to the bracket, and begins a tournament when the conditions are right.	\item All of the round statistics are managed by the \texttt{Match Manager} process
	\begin{itemize}		\item To that effect, \texttt{Match Manager} controls player cheating, the \texttt{Tournament Manager} is simply responsible for keeping track of what the Match managers reports from the Match
	\end{itemize}	\item The \texttt{Tournament Manager} keeps track of the wins/losses for each player in a single list throughout the tournament while simultaneously keeping track of the progression of the bracket	\item At the end of the tournament, the \texttt{Tournament Manager} sends the bracket results to the console, along with a list of wins/losses for each player
	\begin{itemize}		\item It is necessary to send both because players may receive byes without winning any Matchs, so both statistics must be recorded 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Match Manager}\begin{itemize} 
	\item Responsible for starting a Match between two \texttt{Players}, as dictated by the \texttt{Tournament Manager}, and keeping track of scores.	\item The \texttt{Match Manager} randomly selects 15 dice to be chosen for that round (assuming the round is not being played under \emph{standard} Yahtzee rules) following the convention described in the homework assignment.
	\item Starts a turn by asking one \texttt{Player} for their move given the first five numbers in the dice roll. (Includes a time-out in this message to check if the player has logged out/ lost connection)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \emph{both} \texttt{Players} lose connection, and do not join within a given time, the \texttt{Match Manager} reports to the \texttt{Tournament Manager} that the atom \texttt{bye} advances.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Player} processes report which dice they want to keep and if they want to use their dice to score points
	\begin{itemize}		\item This allows the Match process to ensure that no cheating occurs; it knows the possible legal moves for each player and allows the game to progress according to those conventions
		\item If the player does not want to use their dice for points yet, they have the option of ``re-rolling" twice, and the \texttt{Match Manager} responds with the next subset of dice.
	\end{itemize}	\item The Match manager keeps a list of dice that the players currently have, so when it receives a message from a player to use their dice for a specific slot on the score card, the Match manager will know whether or not this is a legal move and will respond accordingly
	\begin{itemize}		\item If a \texttt{Player} makes an illegal move (i.e. ``cheats"), an invalid atom will be sent back to the player to make another move
		\item If the \texttt{Player} makes too many consecutive invalid moves (say 3) then the Match manager drops that player from the Match and follows the same protocol as if that player had crashed.
	\item After every turn, the \texttt{Match Manager} sends an ``update" message to each \texttt{Player} containing the revisions to the overall scorecard.
	\end{itemize}	\item If a game results in a tie, then the Match manager discards it and starts a new game.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If there are $(k/2)$ consecutive ties, the \texttt{Match Manager} re-starts the match under \emph{standard} rules, where each of the players is given different dice configurations.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Player}
\begin{itemize}	\item Players are independent processes that interact with the \texttt{Match Manager}'s API to play the match.	\item A \texttt{Player} process is unable to cheat because it does not share its own score card with the \texttt{Match Manager}, but rather the intermediate moves it makes during the Match	\item \texttt{Player} processes will send several atoms to the \texttt{Match Manager} to update game play	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{choose}
		\begin{itemize}			\item this atom is followed by a list of numbers that specify which dice it wants to keep from a given roll
		\end{itemize}		\item \texttt{play}
		\begin{itemize}			\item this atom is followed by a number item on our score list that specifies it wants its current hand to count for points in that spot			\item The \texttt{Match Manager} knows what the player has chosen to keep and what it was given after keeping dice, so the \texttt{Match Manager} knows if this move is valid and how many points it should be worth for the player.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
